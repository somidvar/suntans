In order to run SUNTANS on a local machine, I have installed the following on Ubuntu 18.04 64bit by using sudo apt-get install command.
gcc
g++
gfortran
make
libibverbs-dev
libibmad-dev
libibumad-dev
bison
byacc
libx11-dev
Subsequently, the zlib-1.2.8 and HDF5-1.8.13 and NETCDF4-4.1.3 were installed as below:
cd ZLIB-dir
./configure --prefix=$NetcdfLibrary
make
make all install
cd HDF5-dir
./configure --prefix=$NetcdfLibrary --with-zlib=$NetcdfLibrary
make
make all install
cd NETCDF4-dir
LDFLAGS=-L$NetcdfLibrary/lib CPPFLAGS=-I$NetcdfLibrary/include
./configure --prefix=$NetcdfLibrary
make clean
make all install
Then add the NetcdfLibrary to the bashrc by
vim ~/.bashrc
export NetcdfLibrary=....(whatever it is)
export PATH=$NetcdfLibrary/bin:$PATH
export NETCDF_INCDIR=$NetcdfLibrary/include 
export NETCDF_LIBDIR=$NetcdfLibrary/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NetcdfLibrary/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Exit and save, then refresh the terminal by . ~/.bashrc
Now, download the MVAPICH2-2.3 and install it.
cd mvapich-dir
./configure --prefix=$MpiLibrary
make 
make install
Add the MPI to the bashrc and disable the CMA by
vim ~/.bashrc
export MVAPICH2=.....(whatever it is)
export PATH=$MVAPICH2/bin:$PATH
export MV2_SMP_USE_CMA=0
Exit and save, then refresh the terminal by . ~/.bashrc
Download the parmetis 3.2 and copy-paste it to library directory as it doesn't get configured and installed.
cd $ParmetisLibrary
make realclean
make default
Download Triangle 1.6 and copy-paste it to library directory as it doesn't get configured and installed.
cd $TriangleLibrar
make all
make trilibrary
Add the all these four library to the SUNTANS/main/Makefile.in
